# Enhanced TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) for Gulfstream 550

An advanced Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) specifically designed for Part 135 Charter operators flying Gulfstream 550 aircraft. This system enhances traditional TCAS capabilities with advanced object recognition, predictive analytics, and improved situational awareness.

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Object Recognition
- **Enhanced Classification**: Identifies 12 distinct object types including:
  - Commercial aircraft (narrow-body, wide-body, regional)
  - General aviation aircraft (single-engine, multi-engine, business jets)
  - Military aircraft (fighters, transport, helicopters)
  - Ground vehicles
  - Terrain features
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for each classification
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes visual data at 30 FPS for immediate threat assessment

### 2. Predictive Collision Avoidance
- **Advanced Trajectory Prediction**: Uses historical data and real-time sensor fusion to predict aircraft movements
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates multiple risk factors including:
  - Speed-based risk
  - Altitude-based risk
  - Proximity risk
  - Combined risk score
- **Confidence Decay**: Adjusts prediction confidence over time for more accurate risk assessment

### 3. Enhanced Alert System
- **Five Alert Levels**:
  - CRITICAL: Immediate evasive action required
  - HIGH: Prepare for evasive action
  - MEDIUM: Monitor and maintain separation
  - LOW: Continue monitoring
  - NONE: No immediate concerns
- **Detailed Alert Information**:
  - Separation distance
  - Time to closest point of approach
  - Confidence level
  - Risk factors
  - Recommended actions

### 4. Multi-Sensor Fusion
- **Data Sources**:
  - Transponder data (Mode S)
  - Radar returns
  - Visual sensor data
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Size features
  - Motion features
  - Shape features
- **Weighted Fusion**: Optimized sensor fusion weights for Gulfstream 550 operations

## Advantages Over Traditional TCAS

1. **Enhanced Situational Awareness**
   - More detailed object classification
   - Better understanding of surrounding traffic
   - Improved terrain awareness

2. **Earlier Threat Detection**
   - Predictive analytics for potential conflicts
   - Confidence-based risk assessment
   - Multiple risk factor consideration

3. **Reduced False Alerts**
   - Advanced classification reduces misidentification
   - Confidence scoring helps filter out low-probability threats
   - Multi-sensor fusion improves accuracy

4. **Better Decision Support**
   - Detailed risk factors for informed decision-making
   - Time-based confidence decay for better planning
   - Clear recommended actions based on risk level

tcas = EnhancedTCAS()

# Process sensor data
result = tcas.process_update(
    ownship_data=ownship_sensor_data,
    intruder_data=intruder_sensor_data
)

# Handle alerts
if result['alerts']:
    for alert in result['alerts']:
        print(f"Alert Level: {alert['level']}")
        print(f"Message: {alert['message']}")
        print(f"Recommended Action: {alert['recommended_action']}")
```
